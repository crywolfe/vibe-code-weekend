# App Idea Validation Guide
## Preparing for Vibe Code Weekend Success

Thank you for registering for Vibe Code Weekend! This guide will help you develop and validate your app idea to ensure it's achievable within our two-day workshop. Taking time to prepare now will dramatically increase your chances of leaving with a functional, deployed web application.

## Why Preparation Matters

Vibe coding with AI makes building applications faster and more accessible, but it still operates within certain constraints. The most successful workshop participants are those who arrive with well-defined, appropriately scoped ideas. This guide will help you refine your concept to set you up for success. Please note that your app idea and the application you build during the workshop are entirely your own.

## Step 1: Basic App Concept

Start by answering these questions:

1. **What problem does your app solve?** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Who is your primary user?** (Be specific: "small business owners tracking inventory" is better than "everyone")
3. **What are the top 2-3 tasks your app should help users accomplish?**

## Step 2: Realistic Scope Assessment

For a weekend workshop, successful apps typically have these characteristics:

✅ **DO** focus on apps that:
- Solve a single, specific problem
- Have 2-4 key features
- Use simple data storage (like CSV files or basic databases)
- Display information in straightforward ways (tables, simple charts)
- Require only basic user inputs (forms, dropdowns, toggles)
- Generates AI content using local generative AI inference

❌ **AVOID** apps that:
- Connect to external APIs requiring authentication
- Process images or video
- Require complex algorithms or machine learning
- Need real-time updates or notifications
- Involve e-commerce or payments
- Require user authentication (login systems)
- Need to store sensitive/personal data
- Depend on mobile-specific features (camera, GPS)

## Step 3: Feature Prioritization Worksheet

List all possible features for your app, then prioritize them:

| Feature | Description | Priority (1-3) | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Feature 1 | Brief description | 1 = Must-have | |
| Feature 2 | Brief description | 2 = Nice-to-have | |
| Feature 3 | Brief description | 3 = Future enhancement | |

**For the workshop, focus only on Priority 1 (Must-have) features.**

## Step 4: Data Requirements

Answer these questions about your app's data needs:

1. What types of information will your app store? (e.g., text, numbers, dates)
2. How many different types of objects will your app track? (e.g., users, tasks, products)
3. What are the relationships between these objects, if any?
4. How will users input data? (Forms, file uploads, etc.)
5. How will data be displayed back to users? (Tables, charts, cards, etc.)

## Step 5: User Interface (UI) Sketch

Create a simple sketch of your main screens (paper drawings are fine!):

1. **Main view/dashboard**: What will users see first?
2. **Input forms**: How will users add or edit information?
3. **Display views**: How will information be presented?

You don't need to be an artist - stick figures and boxes are perfectly acceptable!

## Step 6: Success Criteria

Define what "success" means for your app by completing this statement:

"By the end of the weekend, my app will allow users to ________________."

This should be specific, measurable, and limited to 1-3 core functions.

## Example: Budget Tracker App

Here's an example of a well-scoped app idea:

**Problem:** People struggle to track where their money goes each month.

**Primary User:** Young professionals managing personal finances.

**Top Tasks:**
1. Record expenses by category
2. View monthly spending by category
3. Compare spending against a budget

**Feature Prioritization:**
- Priority 1: Expense entry form, category assignment, monthly summary view
- Priority 2: Budget setting and comparison
- Priority 3: (Future) Recurring expenses, savings goals

**Data Requirements:**
- Store: Expense amounts (numbers), dates, categories (text), notes (text)
- Objects: Expenses, Categories, (Future: Budgets)
- Input: Simple form for entering expenses
- Display: Bar chart for monthly categories, table of recent expenses

**Success Criteria:** By the end of the weekend, my app will allow users to record expenses with categories and view their monthly spending breakdown by category in a visual chart.

## Example: Plant Personality Matchmaker

**Problem:** People often purchase houseplants without understanding their care requirements, leading to plant death and frustration.

**Primary User:** Aspiring plant parents who want to find houseplants that match their lifestyle and home environment.

**Top Tasks:**
1. Answer questions about lifestyle, home conditions, and preferences
2. Receive personalized plant recommendations based on inputs
3. Access care guides for recommended plants

**Feature Prioritization:**
- Priority 1: Lifestyle/environment assessment quiz, personalized plant recommendations, basic care information
- Priority 2: Detailed plant care guides with watering schedules
- Priority 3: (Future) User plant collection tracking, care reminder notifications

**Data Requirements:**
- Store: Plant data (text, numbers for care difficulty), environment preferences (light, water needs), user quiz responses
- Objects: Plants, Care Requirements, User Preferences
- Input: Multiple-choice questionnaire about lifestyle and home conditions
- Display: Personality-matched plant cards with compatibility score, basic care icons

**UI Sketch:**
1. **Quiz Screen**: Series of simple questions with visual options (e.g., "How much natural light does your space get?" with images representing different light levels)
2. **Results Screen**: Matching plants displayed as cards with photos, compatibility percentage, and key care indicators
3. **Plant Detail View**: When a plant card is clicked, shows expanded care information and personality match explanation

**Success Criteria:** By the end of the weekend, my app will allow users to complete a lifestyle quiz and receive personalized plant recommendations that match their environment and care capabilities, along with basic care guides for each recommended plant.
